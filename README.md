## 🎯 Problem Organization

Solutions are organized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) to track progression and target practice areas effectively.

### Naming Convention
- Files are named using kebab-case matching LeetCode problem titles
- Example: `two-sum.ts`, `add-two-numbers.ts`, `longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.ts`

## 💡 Solution Format

Each solution includes:
- **Problem description**: Brief description with LeetCode problem number
- **Approach**: Explanation of the algorithm and data structures used
- **Time Complexity**: Big O notation for time
- **Space Complexity**: Big O notation for space
- **Implementation**: Clean, well-commented code

## 🧪 Testing

All solutions include corresponding test cases to validate correctness and edge cases.

## 📚 Learning Resources

Check the `docs/` folder for:
- **patterns.md**: Common algorithmic patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, DP, etc.)
- **topics.md**: Problems categorized by topic (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.)

## 🎓 Focus Areas

This repository emphasizes:
- Code efficiency and optimization
- Clean, readable code
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Understanding time/space complexity trade-offs
- Mastering common DSA patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the difficulty level you want to practice
3. Study the solution approach and implementation
